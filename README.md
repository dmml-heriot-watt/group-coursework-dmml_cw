## Initial Project Proposal

> [!NOTE]
>Wine Dataset
1. Decision tree to find which wine has best quality .
2. Clustering based on quality or chemical properties like alcohol, sugar,  acid content etc .

>Fruit Dataset
1. For Neural Networks and CNN
2. Classification or Regression    
3. Performance Assessment: to measure accuracy, precision, recall, F score etc.
4. Generalization: to make accurate prediction for new data
5. Optimization: to achieve the best possible performance by adjusting parameters
### Research objectives

> [!NOTE]
> What are the questions you are trying to answer? What are the goals of your project?

### Milestones

> [!NOTE]
> Create a bullet list of the key milestones for your project. Discuss these with your group. You may need to update these as the project progresses.
