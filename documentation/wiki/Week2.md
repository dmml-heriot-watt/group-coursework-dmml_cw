1.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332826297_Prediction_of_Quality_for_Different_Type_of_Wine_based_on_Different_Feature_Sets_Using_Supervised_Machine_Learning_Techniques/related

This research investigates machine learning techniques to evaluate wine quality using attributes. It employs white and red wine datasets, utilizing genetic algorithm and simulated annealing for feature selection. Performance measures like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were used to compare various feature sets and supervised learning methods, including nonlinear, linear, and probabilistic classifiers. The study concludes that feature selection significantly improves prediction performance compared to using all features.

This paper introduces an intelligent approach utilizing the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm for feature selection and employing both nonlinear and probabilistic classifiers. Performance metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were compared using both original feature sets (OFS) and reduced feature sets (RFS). 

3.	https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344650812_Wine_Quality_and_Taste_Classification_Using_Machine_Learning_Model

This paper delves into various machine learning techniques for assessing wine quality, considering diverse metrics and wine-related attributes. It employs multiple machine learning algorithms to rank wine quality like logistic regression, Stochastic descent of the gradient, support Vector classifier, Random forest and understand factors that enhance wine taste.
