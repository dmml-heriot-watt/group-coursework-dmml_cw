## Datasets
1. [Wine Dataset](https://github.com/dmml-heriot-watt/group-coursework-dmml_cw/tree/main/data/wine%20quality)
The Wine dataset includes a diverse set of features such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and wine type. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for the following project objectives:

-  **Decision Tree for Quality Prediction:**
    
    -   Utilize a Decision Tree algorithm to identify the key features influencing wine quality.
    -   Determine which combination of attributes contributes most to classifying wines into different quality categories.
-  **Clustering Analysis:**
    
    -   Explore clustering techniques to group wines based on quality or chemical properties.
    -   Investigate inherent patterns within the dataset, grouping wines with similar characteristics in terms of alcohol content, sugar levels, acid content, and more.
2. [Fruit Dataset](https://github.com/dmml-heriot-watt/group-coursework-dmml_cw/tree/main/data/fruits-360-original-size)
The Fruit Dataset comprises image data of various fruits. With this dataset, our plan is to:

-  **Neural Networks and CNN:**
    
    -   Develop and implement Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
- **Classification:**
    
    -   Utilize machine learning models for classifying fruits into different categories.
- **Performance Assessment:**
    
    -   Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Generalization:**
    
    -   Aim to create models that can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data beyond the training set.
-  **Optimization:**
    
    -   Systematically adjust model parameters and explore hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.
